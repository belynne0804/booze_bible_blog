These are reflections by a crappy Christian mid-deconstruction about the intersection of movies and Christian themes. 
I still deeply love, and am fascinated by, Jesus, so a strong focus on messianic archetypes in film follows. 

I'm a budding developer, so this is also a platform to practice VueJS and front-end dev skills.
